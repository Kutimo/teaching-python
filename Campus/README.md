1- while loop
2- break and continue.
3- some assignments and activities are in the course Moodle page.  
4- if you have sometime, talk about list. I have not taught it yet. but you can give an introduction.

most of students got the while loop and break and continue. but some of them struggling with "while True" and also "continue". if you could focus on that, it would be amazing.
